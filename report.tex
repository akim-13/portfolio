\section{Introduction (2 pages)}
Increasingly, medical advice and research is showing that minor changes to an individual’s daily routines can have positive effects on their overall health, wellbeing and productivity. For example, we are often reminded of the advantages of walking 10,000 steps (Tudor-Locke et al., 2011), sleeping for at least 7 hours (Watson et al., 2015) and drinking at least 6 cups of water (NHS, 2023) every day. However, as discussed by Madore and Wagner (2019), processing multiple tasks concurrently can lead to reduced efficiency. Therefore, tools to aid in the tracking and pursuing of these personal development goals are likely to help an individual reach their goals more effectively.\par

PI(Personal Informatics) software is software designed to help collect and analyse data about an individual with the aim of promoting self-understanding and betterment. A PI system could be an ideal solution to this issue as it could be very useful in allowing an individual to monitor and streamline their progress towards their goals for self-improvement.\par

However, in designing a PI system it is important to ensure user engagement; if a user stops using a system then the system cannot help them. Kersten-van Dijk et al. (2017) found that the studies they reviewed which discussed users dropping out of using a PI system reported dropout rates of 7-44\%. This suggests that a significant proportion of people might not feel motivated to continue using PI software. Furthermore, Jones and Kelly (2018) found that presenting users with too much information could leave them feeling overwhelmed; Rapp and Cena (2016) found that first-time users of PI systems could find the act of recording their data burdensome; and Potapov et al. (2021) discovered that teenagers often found PI systems either controlling or confusing depending on the way they were designed.\par

Fortunately, some of these studies, as well as many others, have investigated how to make a PI software system effective for its users and proposed ways of designing systems with this in mind. For instance, Jones and Kelly (2018) suggested that, to avoid overwhelming users, a system should only show the user information that is interesting to them. They found that 'interesting information' was that which was surprising, useful or statistically significant. It was also found that users found it more interesting when insights could be provided between aspects of their life, rather than within them. Rapp and Cena (2016) recommended providing users with tailored summaries and targets; control over their data; and reviews of past data. In this way they suggested that feelings of freedom and nostalgia might be fostered, increasing positive views and connections with the software. Potapov et al. emphasise the importance of finding an appropriate balance between constraints to orient the user towards positive goals and freedom to allow them to use the tool in a way that suits them. Additionally, a study by Loerakker et al. (2023) showed that promoting self-compassion through the design of a Personal Informatics system can foster positive self-reflection while reducing the chances of rumination and cessation of goal pursuit. The study showed that framing data positively can promote self-compassion. For example, highlighting positive achievements rather than criticising poorer performance.\par

Our intention is to create a PI system aimed at current university students. To  decide on a list of metrics for our system to track, we investigated the interests of our chosen demographic by means of a Google Forms survey. The survey, which was sent to students online, revealed that 60\% of respondents were most interested in tracking their health, followed by 30\% who were most interested in tracking their own learning and development. In addition, when asked to rate their interest in tracking their data for self-improvement on a scale of 1-10, 55\% of participants rated their interest at 8 or above. This reinforced our belief that a PI system would be popular among our target audience. We also conducted some individual interviews of students involving more specific questions about health and desirable PI system features. These interviews revealed an interest in graphs and a simple user interface which we will take into account when designing our application. All the students we interviewed also expressed a desire to alter the number of hours of sleep they got on a daily basis. Based on these investigations, as well as research into Fitbit and Garmin software, we decided that our system would track hours of sleep, water intake, steps taken and hours spent productively.\par

Our system will allow data to be entered manually. Some metrics will also be able to collect data automatically via the Fitbit API to reduce the burden of data entry. Additionally, our software will allow users to set personal goals and see useful data about their performance. This data will be able to showcase correlation in each metric against time individually and between separate metrics. This functionality will all be accessed via a desktop application with a graphical user interface. We hope that, by tracking these four important aspects of student life, our system will provide interesting and useful insights that guide our users towards better health and productivity while ensuring that they are not overwhelmed by too much data or the need to balance their goals.


\section{Agile Software Process Planning and Management (2 pages)}
\textbf{This section must describe how you carried out your project as an Agile process, including
how you planned and tracked your sprints, and how Scrum meetings were used to manage
the evolution of your idea and the features you decided to include in your software system.}\par
To carry out this project in an efficient and organised manner, we followed Agile practices and values using the Scrum framework. This involved using a series of week-long sprints to break up and work through the continuously evolving product backlog. Between each sprint, a meeting was held to discuss the outcome of the previous sprint, go over any changes to the product backlog, produce a sprint backlog and divide this sprint backlog between the group members for completion during the next sprint. During sprints, group members worked either individually or as part of a smaller group to complete their allocated element of the sprint backlog. Regular scrum meetings were also used to allow group members to communicate progress, plans, obstacles and key information. We assigned a scrum master to gain a full understanding of Agile values and methodologies and ensure the group's adherence to them. A product owner was also chosen to be in charge of managing the product backlog and organising sprints.\par

Our first sprint was devoted towards research into PI systems and what students wanted in one. Three group members were assigned to researching PI systems, two to market research, two to gauging interest in students, one to compiling the initial project backlog and one to researching the most appropriate programming language to use for the project. By the end of the week, all members had fulfilled the duties assigned to them. The research was discussed as a group and used to produce the idea for our system. As this idea evolved, it was converted into a list of functional requirements and added to the product backlog.\par

The second sprint consisted of designing and beginning to create our application. A member of the team set up a framework for our project on GitHub and two team members were assigned the task of creating a UI(User Interface) diagram for our application. Having done this, the UI designers presented the result in a scrum meeting and, based on this, other members of the group created a coding plan, started creating the UI and implemented some basic functionality. Meanwhile, a group member worked on creating a database and demonstrating the use of it; another researched and showcased the use of a suitable API; and the remaining people began the writing of the report. The scrum meetings held throughout the week were key in ensuring that all the programmers could stay abreast of any important changes made by others with impacts on their own work, as well as allowing the sharing and discussion of issues. At the end of the sprint, all available team members attended a Google Meet meeting in which all progress was discussed. The sprint was very successful, with every individual achieving their designated goals. Based on the API research conducted, it was decided that the Fitbit API was most suitable for our system. This evolution of the idea of our project meant that the product backlog was updated.\par

The sprint that followed largely prioritised the implementation of desired functionalities from the product backlog. Five members of the group were individually allocated to specific aspects of the program. This included implementing the productive time tracker, achievements, goals, graphs and the Fitbit API integration. The other available group members were given sections of the report to work on. During the frequent scrum meetings in this sprint, reporting back was important to maintain a full understanding of the latest changes among the programmers.


\section{Specification of Software Requirements (5 pages)}

This section breaks down what we need for our Personal Informatics (PI) system, 
focusing on helping students keep up with their fitness and study goals. 
We've used feedback from surveys, talks with users, and research articles to 
figure out what features our system should have. Our aim is to make a system 
that really helps students improve their daily habits and studies.\par

III.1. Establishing Detailed System Requirements
We started by asking people what they're looking for in an app like ours. We found out that most students are really into tracking their fitness (60%) and want to keep an eye on their learning progress too (30%). This helped us get a good idea of what our app should focus on.
Next, we looked at what users said about our initial ideas and checked out what experts say in articles. People told us they like apps that are easy to use but still do a lot. They also want to connect with friends through the app and like the idea of seeing all their info in one place.\par
After all this, we made a final list of what our app needs to do. We're making sure it's good at tracking health and study time, lets users share their progress with friends, and keeps all their data safe and private.\par
 
III.2. Specific Domain Description (will add more thing to this after the meeting, this is an example)
The PI system is intricately designed with a student demographic at its core, addressing their unique challenges such as managing academic deadlines alongside maintaining a balanced lifestyle.\par
Students grapple with the dual challenges of academic accountability and physical well-being. The system is poised to provide an integrative suite of tools for effective study habits, fitness tracking, and fostering a socially supportive ecosystem.\par
 
III.3. Uses
Our app is mainly for people who need a hand managing their time healthily. We know many people have difficulty balancing their work and their private life. Our app aims to help them track their life style along with their diet\par
-    Tracking sleep time: The system will calculate the time users spend a day for sleeping and do statistic with it to find a pattern.\\
-    Tracking calorie intake: The system receive the calorie intake everyday by users and find a pattern along with comparing with the calorie that users spend that day and give suggestion about their diet.\\
-    Calculating calorie output: From the exercises that users take, the system will find out how much energy do users burn in a day and use them along with calorie intake to make suggestion about life style and diet.\\
-    Challenges: Users can do challenges themselves or with their friends. They can choose the difficulty of the challenges and it can be changed everyday if users may want to do other kinds or difficulties of challenge.\\
…
(Add more later)
III.4. Requirement
III.4.1. Functional Requirements
-    Data Tracking: Users should be able to easily enter and track their sleep hours, physical activities, and more. And we uses different means to track every users behavior.\\
-    Social Features: The app should offer social interaction, such as challenges and sharing achievements with friends.\\
-    Notifications: Customizable reminders to help users stay on track with their goals.\\
-    Account system: Users can register and have their own accounts to manage their data easier\\
-    Allow users to enter data that is not tracked: This can help with stats like calorie intake or why kind of food they ate so that the app know additional data, which makes it easier to find users’ behaviour pattern.\\
-    Compare users’ data overtime: This function help users manage the difference in a specific type of data over days or hours, this help them to know if the changes they make are positive or negative.\\
-    Allow users to compare different data together in a fixed time: Some of the data might link to another somehow, eg mood might affect sleep quality, lack or spare of exercises might affect mood and sleep quality as well, so this make both users and the system so see clearly how changes affect users life style and to come up with solutions to improve behaviour pattern.\\
-    Challenges: Allow users to set, change their goals, it can be social, such as friendly challenges between classmates. The system should have suggestions to users in setting their goals and the time frame to make it suitable to the users, or else they might lose interest over time if they set all the goals too difficult and could not finish any of it.\\
 
III.4.2. Non-Functional Requirements
-    Usability: The app must be intuitive and simple to navigate for all users.\\
-    Scalability: It should be capable of handling an increase in users and additional features over time.\\
-    Security: User data must be kept secure, with privacy settings that users can control.\\
-    Performance: The app needs to be responsive and reliable, providing a smooth user experience.\\
-    Follow SCRUM framework: We have sprints and meeting every week to make sure everything go smoothly, and we have a Scrum Master to make sure that the progress is in the right way.\\
-    Expanding initial requirements: pending\\
-    Background research: We did articles research, however, most of them are in the PI field, which narrows down our view on how to build the system. It is helpful if we do more research outside of this field which might give us more idea about functional requirements and how to implement them.\\
-    	Testing: pending\\



\section{Design (5 pages)}

This section should include:

A set of UML models describing the low-level design of your system (class models,
sequence diagrams, etc.)

A justification of your chosen design. This should explicitly show how your design
meets both functional and non-functional requirements, making direct reference
them and the rationale behind your design as it embodies your PI idea.

Make sure you include explanatory text with your design models: the meaning of a diagram
Page 9 of 11
is very rarely self-evident because it depends on an explanatory frame for interpretation. So
you must make sure to express in words what you wish the reader to understand by them.


The class diagram, derived from our database Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), illustrates the intricate structure of our Personal Informatics system, designed specifically for tracking and managing various user-centric activities. This diagram provides a visual representation of the data relationships and is critical in guiding the development process to ensure the system meets both functional and non-functional requirements effectively.\par

User Class: Central to our system, the User class captures essential personal identifiers and account information for each user. Attributes include Username, Email, and Password, which are fundamental for ensuring secure user authentication and system access. This class acts as the primary entity with which other classes associate, establishing a one-to-many relationship across various data-tracking entities. Each instance of a User can associate with multiple records in subordinate classes, reflecting the diverse activities and metrics tracked by the system.\par

UserAchievements Class: This class stores specific achievements of users, linked directly to the User class. Attributes like Username, Date, ActivityID, TimeFrameID, and Value allow for detailed recording and analysis of user accomplishments across different activities and timeframes. It enables the system to provide feedback and insights based on historical achievement data, supporting motivational features such as goal setting and progress tracking.\par

UserStep Class: Dedicated to tracking the physical activity of steps taken, this class includes attributes such as Username, Date, and Steps. By recording daily step counts, the UserStep class feeds into the system’s health monitoring and fitness tracking capabilities, allowing users to set and monitor physical activity goals.\par

UserSleep Class: Focusing on sleep habits, this class records the duration of sleep per day for each user with attributes Username, Date, and SleepHour. It is vital for analyzing sleep patterns and correlating them with other health metrics, which is essential for offering personalized health insights and improving user well-being.\par

UserWork Class: This class tracks work and study sessions, an essential feature for our student users. Attributes include Username, WorkName, Date, and Endtime, facilitating the tracking of academic and work-related activities over time. This functionality supports students in managing their time and productivity more effectively.\par

UserWater Class: Monitoring hydration, the UserWater class includes attributes such as Username, Date, and LitresDrank. Hydration tracking is crucial for overall health, and this class allows the system to remind users to stay hydrated and track their daily water intake.\par

UserGoals Class: As a strategic component of our system, the UserGoals class holds data related to the personal objectives of users. With attributes like Username, ActivityID, TimeFrameID, Date, and Value, this class supports the setting and monitoring of personalized goals, enhancing the system's capability to drive user engagement and encourage behavior modification.\par



\section{Software Testing (Verification) (2 pages)}

This section should include:

Testing plans, indicating how you planned to perform verification of your PI system.
These plans should reflect your requirements and design work, and be completed
before any implementation (coding) work begins.

Evidence of testing - test case results.


\section{Reflection and Conclusion (4 pages)}

This section should include two main sections:

A critique of your software system’s requirements specification, design and testing,
including what might be improved and why you feel it would be better with these
changes.

A critical reflection on the group’s software process, including evidence of Agility in
your software process, evidence of having evolved your requirements to reflect
changes in understanding of problem and viability of designs.
