\section{Introduction (2 pages)}

An account of the problem your software system is intended to address, including a
description of the problem area (Personal Informatics) supported by relevant literature (See
NFR3.1 and NFR3.2), what can make a PI software system effective for its users, and a clear
statement of the main idea behind your particular PI software system.


\section{Agile Software Process Planning and Management (2 pages)}

This section must describe how you carried out your project as an Agile process, including
how you planned and tracked your sprints, and how Scrum meetings were used to manage
the evolution of your idea and the features you decided to include in your software system.


\section{Specification of Software Requirements (5 pages)}

This section breaks down what we need for our Personal Informatics (PI) system, focusing on helping students keep up with their fitness and study goals. We've used feedback from surveys, talks with users, and research articles to figure out what features our system should have. Our aim is to make a system that really helps students improve their daily habits and studies.

III.1. Establishing Detailed System Requirements
We started by asking people what they're looking for in an app like ours. We found out that most students are really into tracking their fitness (60%) and want to keep an eye on their learning progress too (30%). This helped us get a good idea of what our app should focus on.
Next, we looked at what users said about our initial ideas and checked out what experts say in articles. People told us they like apps that are easy to use but still do a lot. They also want to connect with friends through the app and like the idea of seeing all their info in one place.
After all this, we made a final list of what our app needs to do. We're making sure it's good at tracking health and study time, lets users share their progress with friends, and keeps all their data safe and private.
 
III.2. Specific Domain Description (will add more thing to this after the meeting, this is an example)
The PI system is intricately designed with a student demographic at its core, addressing their unique challenges such as managing academic deadlines alongside maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
Students grapple with the dual challenges of academic accountability and physical well-being. The system is poised to provide an integrative suite of tools for effective study habits, fitness tracking, and fostering a socially supportive ecosystem.
 
III.3. Uses
Our app is mainly for people who need a hand managing their time healthily. We know many people have difficulty balancing their work and their private life. Our app aims to help them track their life style along with their diet
-    Tracking sleep time: The system will calculate the time users spend a day for sleeping and do statistic with it to find a pattern.
-    Tracking calorie intake: The system receive the calorie intake everyday by users and find a pattern along with comparing with the calorie that users spend that day and give suggestion about their diet.
-    Calculating calorie output: From the exercises that users take, the system will find out how much energy do users burn in a day and use them along with calorie intake to make suggestion about life style and diet.
-    Challenges: Users can do challenges themselves or with their friends. They can choose the difficulty of the challenges and it can be changed everyday if users may want to do other kinds or difficulties of challenge.

(Add more later)
III.4. Requirement
III.4.1. Functional Requirements
-    Data Tracking: Users should be able to easily enter and track their sleep hours, physical activities, and more. And we uses different means to track every users behavior.
-    Social Features: The app should offer social interaction, such as challenges and sharing achievements with friends.
-    Notifications: Customizable reminders to help users stay on track with their goals.
-    Account system: Users can register and have their own accounts to manage their data easier
-    Allow users to enter data that is not tracked: This can help with stats like calorie intake or why kind of food they ate so that the app know additional data, which makes it easier to find users’ behaviour pattern.
-    Compare users’ data overtime: This function help users manage the difference in a specific type of data over days or hours, this help them to know if the changes they make are positive or negative.
-    Allow users to compare different data together in a fixed time: Some of the data might link to another somehow, eg mood might affect sleep quality, lack or spare of exercises might affect mood and sleep quality as well, so this make both users and the system so see clearly how changes affect users life style and to come up with solutions to improve behaviour pattern.
-    Challenges: Allow users to set, change their goals, it can be social, such as friendly challenges between classmates. The system should have suggestions to users in setting their goals and the time frame to make it suitable to the users, or else they might lose interest over time if they set all the goals too difficult and could not finish any of it.
 
III.4.2. Non-Functional Requirements
-    Usability: The app must be intuitive and simple to navigate for all users.
-    Scalability: It should be capable of handling an increase in users and additional features over time.
-    Security: User data must be kept secure, with privacy settings that users can control.
-    Performance: The app needs to be responsive and reliable, providing a smooth user experience.
-    Follow SCRUM framework: We have sprints and meeting every week to make sure everything go smoothly, and we have a Scrum Master to make sure that the progress is in the right way.
-    Expanding initial requirements: pending
-    Background research: We did articles research, however, most of them are in the PI field, which narrows down our view on how to build the system. It is helpful if we do more research outside of this field which might give us more idea about functional requirements and how to implement them.
-    	Testing: pending



\section{Design (5 pages)}

This section should include:

A set of UML models describing the low-level design of your system (class models,
sequence diagrams, etc.)

A justification of your chosen design. This should explicitly show how your design
meets both functional and non-functional requirements, making direct reference
them and the rationale behind your design as it embodies your PI idea.

Make sure you include explanatory text with your design models: the meaning of a diagram
Page 9 of 11
is very rarely self-evident because it depends on an explanatory frame for interpretation. So
you must make sure to express in words what you wish the reader to understand by them.


\section{Software Testing (Verification) (2 pages)}

This section should include:

Testing plans, indicating how you planned to perform verification of your PI system.
These plans should reflect your requirements and design work, and be completed
before any implementation (coding) work begins.

Evidence of testing - test case results.


\section{Reflection and Conclusion (4 pages)}

This section should include two main sections:

A critique of your software system’s requirements specification, design and testing,
including what might be improved and why you feel it would be better with these
changes.

A critical reflection on the group’s software process, including evidence of Agility in
your software process, evidence of having evolved your requirements to reflect
changes in understanding of problem and viability of designs.

the third appendix.
Also, you may include earlier design models to evidence how your ideas have evolved as an
appendix. if you wish to include, as well as any unit tests or additional test runs you might
