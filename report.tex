        \normalsize\textbf{Abstract:} This document outlines the development of
        a Custom Personal Informatics (PI) System designed to aid university
        students in managing and improving their personal health and
        productivity. The need for such a system is derived from the growing
        understanding that simple changes in daily routines can significantly
        impact an individual's overall well-being and effectiveness. The
        system's development followed an agile methodology, with features
        incrementally added and refined over five completed sprints. Our PI
        system is designed to track critical metrics such as sleep, water
        intake, steps, and productive hours. Each of these metrics was chosen
        based on extensive initial research including surveys and interviews
        with the target demographic, ensuring the system's relevance and
        utility. As of the third sprint, the system successfully integrates
        manual data entry with automated data collection via the Fitbit API,
        offering users a comprehensive overview of their habits. It also
        provides motivational tools like goal setting and achievement tracking
        to encourage continual use and engagement. Future work on the system
        will focus on enhancing user interaction by refining the UI for greater
        intuitiveness and adding features that allow users to compare their
        performance with peers, fostering a competitive yet supportive
        environment. By continuously evolving the system based on user feedback
        and emerging research, we aim to increase the positive impact of the
        system on users' lives.

\section{Introduction}

Increasingly, medical advice and research is showing that minor changes to an
individual’s daily routines can have positive effects on their overall health,
wellbeing and productivity. For example, we are often reminded of the
advantages of walking 10,000 steps (Tudor-Locke et al., 2011), sleeping for at
least 7 hours (Watson et al., 2015) and drinking at least 6 cups of water (NHS,
2023) every day. However, as discussed by Madore and Wagner (2019), processing
multiple tasks concurrently can lead to reduced efficiency. Therefore, tools to
aid in the tracking and pursuing of these personal development goals are likely
to help an individual reach their goals more effectively.\par

PI(Personal Informatics) software is software designed to help collect and
analyse data about an individual with the aim of promoting self-understanding
and betterment (Li, I., 2012\footnote{Article from the specifications}).
A PI system could be an ideal solution to this issue as it
could be very useful in allowing an individual to monitor and streamline their
progress towards their goals for self-improvement.\par

However, in designing a PI system it is important to ensure user engagement; if
a user stops using a system then the system cannot help them. Kersten-van Dijk
et al. (2017) found that the studies they reviewed which discussed users
dropping out of using a PI system reported dropout rates of 7-44\%. This
suggests that a significant proportion of people might not feel motivated to
continue using PI software. Furthermore, Jones and Kelly (2018) found that
presenting users with too much information could leave them feeling
overwhelmed; Rapp and Cena (2016) found that first-time users of PI systems
could find the act of recording their data burdensome; and Potapov et al.
(2021) discovered that teenagers often found PI systems either controlling or
confusing depending on the way they were designed.\par

Fortunately, some of these studies, as well as many others, have investigated
how to make a PI software system effective for its users and proposed ways of
designing systems with this in mind. For instance, Jones and Kelly (2018)
suggested that, to avoid overwhelming users, a system should only show the user
information that is interesting to them. They found that 'interesting
information' was that which was surprising, useful or statistically
significant. It was also found that users found it more interesting when
insights could be provided between aspects of their life, rather than within
them. Rapp and Cena (2016) recommended providing users with tailored summaries
and targets; control over their data; and reviews of past data. In this way
they suggested that feelings of freedom and nostalgia might be fostered,
increasing positive views and connections with the software. Potapov et al.
emphasise the importance of finding an appropriate balance between constraints
to orient the user towards positive goals and freedom to allow them to use the
tool in a way that suits them. Additionally, a study by Loerakker et al. (2023)
showed that promoting self-compassion through the design of a Personal
Informatics system can foster positive self-reflection while reducing the
chances of rumination and cessation of goal pursuit. The study showed that
framing data positively can promote self-compassion. For example, highlighting
positive achievements rather than criticising poorer performance.\par


Our intention is to create a PI system aimed at current university students. To
decide on a list of metrics for our system to track, we investigated the
interests of our chosen demographic by means of a Google Forms survey (see
Appendix \ref{app:survey}). The survey, which was sent to students online,
revealed that 60\% of respondents were most interested in tracking their
health, followed by 30\% who were most interested in tracking their own
learning and development. In addition, when asked to rate their interest in
tracking their data for self-improvement on a scale of 1-10, 55\% of
participants rated their interest at 8 or above. This reinforced our belief
that a PI system would be popular among our target audience. 

\newpage

Furthermore, we conducted some individual interviews of students involving more
specific questions about health and desirable PI system features (see Appendix
\ref{app:interviews}). These interviews revealed an interest in graphs and a
simple user interface which we will take into account when designing our
application. All the students we interviewed also expressed a desire to alter
the number of hours of sleep they got on a daily basis. Based on these
investigations, as well as research into Fitbit and Garmin software, we decided
that our system would track hours of sleep, water intake, steps taken and hours
spent productively.\par

Our system will allow data to be entered manually. Some metrics will also be
able to collect data automatically via the Fitbit API to reduce the burden of
data entry. Additionally, our software will allow users to set personal goals
and see useful data about their performance. This data will be able to showcase
correlation in each metric against time individually and between separate
metrics. This functionality will all be accessed via a desktop application with
a graphical user interface. We hope that, by tracking these four important
aspects of student life, our system will provide interesting and useful
insights that guide our users towards better health and productivity while
ensuring that they are not overwhelmed by too much data or the need to balance
their goals.


\section{Agile Software Process Planning and Management}

To carry out this project in an efficient and organised manner, we followed
Agile practices and values using the Scrum framework. This involved using a
series of week-long sprints to break up and work through the continuously
evolving product backlog. Between each sprint, a meeting was held to discuss
the outcome of the previous sprint, go over any changes to the product backlog,
produce a sprint backlog and divide this sprint backlog between the group
members for completion during the next sprint. To maintain clarity and access
to information, minutes were taken of these meetings and stored in the project
GitHub repository. This meant that developers could always access information
about the progress of other developers and their allocated tasks (See Appendix
\ref{app:minutes}). During sprints, group members worked either individually or
as part of a smaller group to complete their allocated element of the sprint
backlog. Regular scrum meetings were also used to allow group members to
communicate progress, plans, obstacles and key information. We assigned a scrum
master to gain a full understanding of Agile values and methodologies and
ensure the group's adherence to them. A product owner was also chosen to be in
charge of managing the product backlog and organising sprints.\par

Our first sprint was devoted towards research into PI systems and what students
wanted in one. Three group members were assigned to researching PI systems, two
to market research, two to gauging interest in students, one to compiling the
initial project backlog and one to researching the most appropriate programming
language to use for the project. By the end of the week, all members had
fulfilled the duties assigned to them. The research was discussed as a group
and used to produce the idea for our system. As this idea evolved, it was
converted into a list of functional requirements and added to the product
backlog.\par

The second sprint consisted of designing and beginning to create our
application. A member of the team set up a framework for our project on GitHub
and two team members were assigned the task of creating a UI (User Interface)
diagram for our application. Having done this, the UI designers presented the
result in a scrum meeting and, based on this, other members of the group
created a coding plan, started creating the UI and implemented some basic
functionality. Meanwhile, a group member worked on creating a database and
demonstrating the use of it; another researched and showcased the use of a
suitable API; and the remaining people began the writing of the report. The
scrum meetings held throughout the week were key in ensuring that all the
programmers could stay abreast of any important changes made by others with
impacts on their own work, as well as allowing the sharing and discussion of
issues. At the end of the sprint, all available team members attended a Google
Meet meeting in which all progress was discussed. The sprint was very
successful, with every individual achieving their designated goals. Based on
the API research conducted, it was decided that the Fitbit API was most
suitable for our system. Additionally, it was concluded that an alternative
database design would be more efficient. These evolutions of the idea of our
project meant that the product backlog was updated.\par

The sprint that followed largely prioritised the implementation of desired
functionalities from the product backlog. Five members of the group were
individually allocated to specific aspects of the program. This included
implementing the productivity tracker, achievements, goals, graphs and the
Fitbit API integration. One developer was also assigned to redesigning the
database to be more efficient. The other available group members were given
sections of the report to work on. During the frequent scrum meetings in this
sprint, reporting back helped maintain a full understanding of the latest
changes among the programmers. Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties,
the sprint backlog was not entirely completed. These incomplete tasks were
added to the sprint backlog of the next sprint. Other than some software
features, all tasks were completed successfully and the next sprint was
discussed and planned as usual.\par

The fourth sprint had very similar aims to the previous one, with team members
allocated to report writing and the development of features, including those
which were not completed during the previous week. By the end of the sprint,
more elements of our system's functionality had been implemented and the report
completed further so these parts of the product backlog were marked as
complete. However, the design section of the report and the achievement
functionality of the system were not completed due to other commitments and the
work tracking section was not fully functional due to technical difficulties.
The completion of these requirements was moved to the following week's
sprint.\par


The fifth, and final, sprint targeted the completion of as yet unimplemented
features and work on the report document. These responsibilities were split so
that roughly half the group was working on each. As well as the programming of
parts of the system, focus was also placed on merging all the functionality
together to create our system as a whole. To align the completion of the 
project with our deadline and allow enough time for the required work, this 
final sprint took place over 11 days, between the 22nd of April and the 3rd of 
May. By the end of the sprint, the entirety of the sprint and product 
backlogs had been completed and the project as a whole was finished.\par

By following the Scrum framework we were able to efficiently divide our work 
into manageable quantities and maintain constant progress towards a timely 
completion, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the methodology.\par

\section{Specification of Software Requirements}

This section establishes the core requirements for our Personal Informatics system, 
focusing on helping students keep up with their fitness and study
goals. We utilised feedback from surveys (see Appendix \ref{app:survey}), talks
with users, market research, and academic research articles to figure out what
features our system should have. Our aim is to make a system that assists
students in improving both their physical health and studying habits whilst not
being overly invasive.\par

In the following sections, the notation \textit{SRQ} will be used to denote
requirements from the coursework's specification, while \textit{ARQ} will
represent Additional Requirements. Refer to Section \ref{sec:reqTable} for a
quick-reference table of requirements.

\newpage

\subsection{Gathering System Requirements}

Initially, we asked people what features they would look for in an personal
improvement application. From these interviews (see Appendix \ref{app:survey}
and \ref{app:interviews}), we identified that most students use PI systems for
tracking their fitness (60\%) and their learning progress (30\%), with the
other 10\% being interested in their environmental impact. This helped us
decide which area of personal informatics our system should focus on. Next, we
looked at what users stated about our initial ideas as well as comparing our
ideas to expert findings from our listed articles (SRQ 3.1, 3.2). Additionally,
many students told us they prefer applications that are intuitive but still
allow for great insight and control into goals and targets. Also, they wished
to connect with their friends and peers through the app and liked the idea of
seeing all their information in a single area. Furthermore, we also researched
into competitor systems (such as Garmin and Fitbit) to identify both good and
bad features of these systems.\par

After this, we made an initial requirement list of what functionality our app must contain (SRQ 2.1, 2.3)
based on the data gathered. We must ensure our system is perfect for tracking
health and study time, allows users to share their progress with friends, and
keeps all their data safe and private. Furthermore, we must regularly reflect on our requirements
to ensure that they properly suit our vision for the system, adapting them whenever tests, feedback, or other factors suggest so.
 

\subsection{Specific Domain of Application}

Our PI system is targeted towards the student demographic,
addressing their unique challenges such as managing academic deadlines
alongside maintaining a balanced lifestyle.\par 

Students grapple with the dual challenges of academic accountability and
physical well-being. The system shall provide a selection of tools for effective
study habits and simple health tracking (SRQ 2.1).
 

\subsection{Data Fields Chosen}

Our app is tailored towards individuals who require assistance managing their time healthily as
we are aware that a large proportion of students have difficulty maintaining a healthy work-life
balance. Our app aims to help them track key aspects of the student lifestyle.
The fields we have chosen to track as well as how they shall be accessed are as follows (SRQ 5.1, 5.3):

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Tracking sleep time}: The average student struggles to manage
        sleep, studying, and being social and out of these three, sleep is
        usually the area in which students choose to disregard in order to
        create more time. However, a lack of sleep can be detrimental on all
        aspects of life and as such it is imperative that we ensure our users
        are aware of how little sleep they may be getting across a given time
        frame. We are aware that some students may also be getting too much
        sleep which can lead to them feeling lethargic throughout the day and
        as such our system should also provide a solution for these users.
        Sleep quality also plays a large role in this but is incredibly
        difficult to track unless specialist equipment is used. Additionally,
        it is usually influenced by factors our system cannot control such as
        noise from other tenants and temperature. This field will require a
        user to manually enter their data. Allowing a user to set goals for
        this field will enable them to prioritise the quantity of sleep they
        are getting each night. Our system should enable our users to obtain a
        consistent, healthy sleep pattern.

    \newpage
    
    \item \textbf{Tracking step count}: The average student spends a large
        proportion of their day sedentary, whether that be from napping after a
        lecture, studying hard for an exam, or sat behind a computer trying to
        finish coursework. This can cause students to not get out frequently
        for events other than their lectures and the occasional social
        gathering. This has hidden consequences: less time outside walking
        means less vitamin D, less opportunity to make new friends, increased
        risk of certain diseases such as heart disease. It is imperative to
        emphasise to our users who do not perform enough steps in a given time
        period that this behaviour is not healthy. Our system will allow a user
        to view trends in their step data and clearly visualise how little (or
        many) steps they are actually performing.

    \item \textbf{Tracking work done}: Students often report one of two
        extremes when it comes to studying: overstudying and losing out on
        other aspects of the student life or understudying and suffering
        academically. Neither of these are healthy for a student. To
        potentially fix this behaviour, our system should allow a user to set
        study goals. This allows the understudying students to have a target to
        achieve in a given time period, motivating them to allocate more time
        to study. Furthermore, this allows the overstudying students to know
        that they have studied a sufficient amount for a given time period and
        deserve a break.
    
    \item \textbf{Tracking water intake}: Water intake has many hidden
        benefits: helps with weight loss by making you feel more full,
        increases energy levels, improves skin health. Many students may
        neglect drinking water as they need an energy boost via caffeinated
        products. By setting clear goals of how much water a user should drink,
        it increases the likelihood they select to drink water over a less
        healthy alternative.

    \item \textbf{Achievements and Goals}: These will be the methods by which goals for a
        user to achieve are set. Their main purpose is to motivate a user to
        change some aspect of their life. Through our research, we discovered
        that by providing some sort of challenge, a user becomes more motivated
        to complete a goal, even if no physical reward (aside from health
        benefits) is provided. By allowing the user to set these goals we
        ensure that the user finds these achievements to be possible and
        further increases the likelihood they change some of their bad habits.
        Additionally, by having system set achievements, a user may be driven to
        greater heights than they think they can achieve.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Motivating Users}

Our system will allow users to set and manage goals (SRQ 7.1, 7.2, 7.3). This can be whatever a user feels is appropriate for any of the given 
fields including the time frame in which they wish to complete the goals. In addition to this, our system will implement achievements.
This will be separate from goals and will be set by our system. For example, a goal for step count could be "walk 10,000 steps today".
Achievements are key to our system as they provide a reason for a user to improve specific fields
without aimlessly trying to increase some number (SRQ 7.4). Furthermore, these
achievements rotate daily, ensuring a user never runs our of goals to achieve.\\

Additionally, we set additional requirements for our system to contain a range
of social features (ARQ 1) including a leaderboard and groups. This was
requested by many of the students we interviewed who wished to use friendly
competition as a motivator (see Appendix \ref{app:interviews}). Unfortunately,
we set the priority for this requirement to low as it did not directly
influence the core behaviour of our system. During the creation of our system,
it was decided that this feature was too complex to implement  given the time limit and unexpected
workload of our higher priority requirements.


\subsection{Comparing User Data}

Our system must ensure a user can easily view and compare all key data fields (SRQ 5.2). This should be 
done through graphs displaying all fields a user selects on the same axis. 
This graph should dynamically change size to fit the upper bound of the data for a given user, 
allowing a user to easily identify any correlation between the data fields (SRQ 6.2).\\

The graph must allow for a user to 
specify a time frame (SRQ 6.2) for the data to allow such that 
it allows the user to identify potential outside factors
that our system cannot consider. For example, an event in a given time frame
such as a coursework deadline could influence sleep count. 


\subsection{Viewing and Collecting Tracking Data}

Users will be given the option to synchronise their step data, both present and
past from a Fitbit account via the Fitbit API(ARQ 2). We must ensure that
potential users without the relevant hardware can still use our system and must
be done in an intuitive way in order to allow our system to be accessible for a
greater amount of students. This will also allow for easy gathering of data
fields which cannot be tracked via physical devices (SRQ 5.1). As only the
study time field can be accessed directly via the Fitbit API, manual entry is
necessary (SRQ 5.3).\par

To ensure that our users understand what data we are storing, each user shall
be allowed to view the data we have stored on them for each of these key
fields(SRQ 5.2). In addition, the security of this data is paramount. We must ensure it
cannot be accessed by any other end users.


\subsection{Scalability and Performance}

Scalability (ARQ 3) will not be a problem for our system as it will run entirely
off of the user's computer. Additionally, in order to allow for completion of our
additional requirements of adding multi-user functionality, our system must
allow for easy scalability. This should be done through a well constructed
database. We must ensure that this system performs smoothly and efficiently to not
hinder a user's experience (ARQ 4).


\subsection{Structuring the Software Development Process}

Our development of this project must very closely follow the agile and SCRUM
development approach. This will be done to ensure our system is consistently
improving and changing to match what our users need. Refer to the Agile Software
Process Planning and Management section for more details (covers all of SRQ 1).

\subsection{Testing}

We must extensively test each code version to ensure that our users will not run
into any bugs or other issues whilst using our system. This shall be driven
largely by simulating the experience an average user will have. Refer to
Section \ref{sec:testing} for more details (covers all of SRQ 4).

\section{Design}

The following section encompasses how we wish to turn our initial requirements 
into a structured plan of how each feature will be implemented. Furthermore, 
it contains many important diagrams and images detailing the specifics of each 
feature that combine to form a complete overview of our system.\par

\subsection{Database ERD Model}

Our Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) demonstrates the structure of 
our PI system's database. This ERD has been specifically constructed
to suit our system's needs and as such is a great guide for the development 
of both the database and system in general as it ensures that all requirements
that need to store data are covered.\par

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \label{fig:PI_ERD}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Figure \ref{fig:PI_ERD} describes the following components:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \texttt{UserStep} Table: This table records all step data
    that the system is provided. By using a compound key
    of the \texttt{Username} and \texttt{Date} fields each user's step count can be stored
    for a given day, with the count being stored in the \texttt{Value} field. By taking these 
    daily inputs, our system can obtain enough data to assist in the improvement of the
    habits of a given user and help them set realistic goals. As the data can also be inserted 
    through an API, this table aims to cover ARQ 2.\par

    \item \texttt{UserSleep} Table: This table is used to record all sleep data 
    that the system is provided. By using a compound key
    of the \texttt{Username} and \texttt{Date} fields each user's sleep time can be stored
    for a given day, with the total time being stored in the \texttt{Value} field. By taking these 
    daily inputs, our system can obtain enough data to assist in the improvement of the
    habits of a given user and help them identify when their sleeping time is either too low or high.\par

    \item \texttt{UserWork} Table: This table records all entries of both working and studying
    a given user performs. By using a compund key of
    the \texttt{Username} and \texttt{Date} fields each user's daily work time can be stored. The \texttt{Value} field holds the time data for each entry.
    By collecting large amounts of this data over an extended period of time, our system can support a user in identifying
    when they should be using their time more effectively.\par

    \item \texttt{UserWater} Table: All entries for the Water field are stored here.
    By using a compund key of the \texttt{Username} and \texttt{Date} fields each user's water 
    intake can be stored and monitored, with the amount of water intake being stored in the \texttt{Value} field.\par

    \newpage

    \item \texttt{UserGoals} Table: The UserGoals table holds data related to the goals set by users.
        With attributes of \texttt{Username}, \texttt{ActivityID} forming a compund key, as well as \texttt{TimeFrameID}, \texttt{Date}, and
        \texttt{Value} storing the data that makes up each goal, this table supports the setting and monitoring of personalised
        goals. \texttt{UserGoals} covers SRQ 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.\par

\end{itemize}

\texttt{UserStep}, \texttt{UserSleep}, \texttt{UserWork} and \texttt{UserWater}
are all aimed to satisfy ARQ 5 and SRQ 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

  \caption{User Class in the Database Model}
  \label{fig:User_Table}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:User_Table} describes our \texttt{User} Table which sits at the centre of our database. 
The User table stores essential personal identifiers and account information for each user. Attributes include \texttt{Username}, \texttt{Email}, and
\texttt{PasswordHash}, which are fundamental for ensuring secure user authentication and
system access. This table acts as the primary entity with which other tables
associate, establishing one-to-many relationships across the many data tracking
tables. Each user can associate with multiple records in the
linked tables, reflecting the diverse activities and metrics tracked by the
system. Ultimately, the requirement of a multi-user system was omitted due to
limitations of time caused by unexpected issues with other development. However, the current database
architecture has been deliberately designed to facilitate the seamless
integration of multi-user capabilities, should it be developed in the future.
This table covers ARQ 1.

\subsection{UML Class Diagram}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.7\linewidth]{UML Class diagram}
  \caption{UML Class Diagram}
  \label{fig:Class}
\end{figure}

The class diagram of our PI system (Figure \ref{fig:Class}) delineates the
fundamental components and their relationships, underscoring the system's
design to efficiently manage and process user data. Central to this
architecture is the \texttt{Database} class, which acts as the primary conduit for all
data manipulation and retrieval activities within the system. This class is
critical for the robust handling of data and supports various functionalities
critical to user interaction and data integrity. We utilised the Dapper module 
in C\#, which facilitates the direct return or insertion of a list of 
C\# objects from an SQL query, rather than handling them as tuples. 
Accordingly, based on the ERD, all classes are designed to integrate seamlessly
with the Dapper package.\par

\newpage

The \texttt{Database} class ensures a singleton pattern for database management,
creating a single, globally accessible instance throughout the application
lifecycle. It manages the database connectivity, facilitating secure and
persistent connections to the data store. Data manipulation methods such as
\texttt{InsertWithQuery()}, \texttt{Insert()}, \texttt{UpdateWithQuery()}, and \texttt{Update()} allow for
efficient data insertion and updating within the database. Retrieval methods
like \texttt{GetUserActivities()} and \texttt{GetUserActivityAt()} fetch activity data for users,
crucial for generating reports and insights. Utility methods including
\texttt{GetStringDataToday()}, \texttt{GetUserGoal()}, and \texttt{DeleteUserGoal()} provide additional
functionality for managing daily data strings and user goals, enhancing the
system’s responsiveness to user interactions. These methods were essential for
SRQ 6.1 and 6.2, as well as directly adhering to SRQ 5.1 and 5.2. \par

The \texttt{ActivityDayInput} and \texttt{GoalInput classes}, are specifically
designed for handling the input and update functionalities related to daily
user activities and goal management, respectively. The
\texttt{ActivityDayInput} Class includes a Prompt string for user guidance and
an Activity \texttt{ActivityType} to specify the type of activity data being
entered. It comprises various user interaction handlers such as
\texttt{UpdateButton\_Click()} and \texttt{InsertOrUpdate()} for data
submission, alongside \texttt{UpdateUserWater()} and \texttt{UpdateUserSteps()}
for updating specific activity metrics. Text handling methods like
\texttt{TextBox\_TextChanged()}, \texttt{TextBox\_KeyDown()} and
\texttt{TextBox\_PreviewTextInput()} ensure data integrity and user input
validation.\par

The GoalInput Class mirrors the ActivityDayInput class in providing prompts and
activity type specifications tailored towards user goals. It features
goal-specific functionalities such as \texttt{DisplayGoal()} for visualising
set goals, \texttt{DeleteGoalButton\_Click()} for goal modification, and
\texttt{GetSumData()} for data aggregation. It inherits text handling and
initialisation methods from ActivityDayInput, ensuring a consistent and
user-friendly interface. Whilst ActivityDayInput stands mainly by SRQ 6.1 and
5.1, GoalInput follows SRQ 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.\par

\subsection{UML Flow Diagram}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.7\linewidth]{UML Flow diagram}
  \caption{UML Flow Diagram}
  \label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

The flow diagram of our PI system (Figure \ref{fig:flow}) illustrates the
interactions between classes, essential for efficient functionality and user
experience. At the core is the MainMenu class, which integrates features like
tracking steps, achievements, water intake, and sleep via separate classes
(Step, Achievement, Water, Sleep). These classes manage specific activities and
are tightly integrated with \texttt{ActivityDayInput} and \texttt{GoalInput} controls for data
entry and goal management.\par

For example, when users input their daily water intake through the
\texttt{ActivityDayInput} tailored for water, this control processes and validates the
data, then interacts with the Water class and the Database to store this
information. Similarly, the \texttt{GoalInput} facilitates setting and updating goals,
interacting directly with the Database to ensure goals are current and
reflective of user activity.\par

The association between the \texttt{ActivityDayInput}, \texttt{GoalInput}, and the \texttt{Database}
ensures immediate data reflection in the system, supporting features like
activity comparison and trend analysis. The \texttt{Database} manages its instance,
maintaining data integrity and security, and acts as a centralised repository
for all user data. This structure ensures seamless data flow across the system,
fulfilling functional and non-functional requirements, and enhancing overall
user interaction. The association between these elements are the groundwork for all requirements SRQ 5, SRQ 6 and SRQ 7, as well as ARQ 4.\par

\newpage

\subsection{User Interface}

This section outlines the design of the user interface (UI) for our PI system,
focusing on creating an intuitive and engaging user experience. We aim to bridge
the gap between the system's technical capabilities and the user's needs through
a well-thought-out interface. The UI design is crafted to facilitate easy
navigation and interaction, ensuring that users can efficiently manage and track
their personal data. Here, we discuss the guiding principles of our UI design and
how they enhance usability and user engagement.\par

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{Main Menu}
  \caption{Main Menu of the Application}
  \label{fig:Menu}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Menu} illustrates the main menu of our application. Positioned in the top left
corner of the screen, the label \texttt{"Menu"} accompanied by a small computer icon indicates
to the user that they are currently viewing the main menu. The background of the 
entire menu is a dark blue, a colour choice designed to minimise eye strain during 
prolonged use of the app.\par

The main menu features four prominent buttons, each corresponding to the core 
functionalities of the Personal Informatics system: steps, work, sleep, and water.
Additionally, two smaller green buttons provide access to sub-functionalities, 
specifically graphs and achievements. Each of the four larger buttons displays 
the type of statistic it relates to, with today's data (or the previous night's
for sleep hours) shown in smaller font size directly below. The design adheres to SRQ 5.2 and 6.1.\par

A unique aspect of the design is a small white checkbox located in the top left
corner of each button. These boxes can be marked by user when they want to see
the related data in graph, and therefore allows for SRQ 6.2 to function smoothly.
Moreover, several boxes can be ticked at once, allowing users to see the relativity of different type of stats in one graph.\par

  \label{fig:Main}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:Main} displays the four main functionality screen, which is designed
to be simpler and more focused compared to the main menu. In the top left corner, a 
dark green \texttt{"BACK"} button allows users to easily return to the main menu.\par 

\newpage

We can clearly see from figure \ref{fig:Work} that the heading \texttt{"WORK"} is
prominently displayed at the top of the screen, accompanied by a book icon to
visually represent the category. Centred on the screen is a large green box that
tracks and displays the user's progress on their weekly achievement goals. Under
the heading \texttt{"Progress for goal this Week"} of the box, the interface
shows the amount of work completed and the specific day of the week the goal was
set. This box can be closed using the small red \texttt{"x"} button located at
its top right corner, providing a way to dismiss the details if desired. Directly
below this display, there is an input bar where users can \texttt{"Add new work"}
they have completed that day. Adjacent to this bar, a plus button is the way to
confirm the work users inserted and start to time it, allowing users to easily
update their daily work achievements. This was designed in this format for ARQ 5.\par

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.4\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Add Work}
    \caption{Add Work bar}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Add Work Interface}
  \label{fig:Work_Interface}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Figure \ref{fig:Work_Interface} illustrates how the functionality Work works. When users dismiss
the progress box, the will see a new input bar, which they can use to add the amount of time that
they work for the time period they chose in the bar (figure \ref{fig:Add_Work}). Another way here
is to insert the type of work users want to do in the \texttt{"Add new work"} bar and then press 
the plus button. The work will appear and the time start running, users can pause it whenever they
like. After finishing the work, users can press the red plus button to add the time they have been
working for to the progress. They can easily check it in the main menu screen.\par

Figure \ref{fig:Steps} presents the steps interface, which maintains a consistent design
with the work screen but introduces several specific modifications. The heading \texttt{"Step"} is
displayed at the top of the screen, distinguished by a shoe icon next to it, replacing the
book symbol used in the work interface. A notable difference in layout is the placement of
the progress box, which is positioned below the input bars rather than above. This adjustment
allows for immediate and easy data entry upon accessing the screen, complying with ARQ 5.\par

\vspace{-7pt}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{Error}
  \caption{Error inserting wrong API Token format}
  \label{fig:Error}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-7pt}

Additionally, a new input bar for inserting an API token has been added to facilitate the integration of step data from
external devices or services and fulfilling ARQ 2. Directly next to the API token input bar are \texttt{"Connect"} and 
\texttt{"Update"} buttons. The \texttt{"Connect"} button is used for verifying the API token, while the \texttt{"Update"}
button adjacent to the Step input bar enables users to refresh and submit their step count 
data. Any incorrect format in the input will trigger an error message, as illustrated in 
figure \ref{fig:Error}, ensuring users are aware of input specifications and can correct their entries accordingly.\par

Figures \ref{fig:Water} and \ref{fig:Sleep} illustrate the design of the Water and Sleep screens,
respectively, which are consistent in layout with the other main functionalities of the app. 
Both screens feature a \texttt{"BACK"} button in the top left corner for easy navigation. The Water 
screen is identified by a heading labeled \texttt{"Water"} accompanied by a water drop icon, and the
Sleep screen is marked by a heading labeled \texttt{"Sleep"} adorned with a \texttt{"zzz"} icon. Each screen 
includes an input bar for users to enter their respective data values easily.\par

In Figure \ref{fig:Water}, showcasing the Water functionality, the progress box is displayed
upon achieving a set goal. It prominently features the message \texttt{"Goal Completed!"} in bold 
golden text, accompanied by a congratulatory message that also specifies the goal achieved.
This positive reinforcement is designed to motivate users and acknowledge their accomplishments, as SRQ 7.4 demands.\par

Conversely, Figure \ref{fig:Sleep} details the Sleep functionality when a goal is not met.
The progress box in this scenario displays a bold, golden headline \texttt{"Goal Not Completed"} at
the top. Below this heading, the screen informs users of the shortfall, specifying the 
amount needed to achieve the goal. In the depicted example, it indicates that the user 
was 20 hours short of reaching the weekly sleep goal. This feedback is intended to 
encourage users to adjust their habits to meet their sleep targets in the future.\par

  \label{fig:subfunc}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Figure \ref{fig:Graphs} showcases the Graph interface of the application, which is
designed to provide a visual representation of user data over time. The screen 
includes a \texttt{"BACK"} button located at the top left corner, allowing users to easily
navigate back to the main menu. The heading \texttt{"Graphs"}, marked with a small graph icon,
indicates the functionality of the interface.\par

The main feature of this interface is a large line graph, titled at the top to
specify the type of data being displayed. Users have the flexibility to select
the timeline for the graph, ranging from a day to a year, with the current
example set to display data over a year. The timeline is plotted on the
horizontal axis, while the specific metrics related to the user’s activities
are displayed along the vertical axis. The graph utilises a light blue line on
a gridded white background, enhancing readability and making it easier for
users to interpret their data trends. The graph is also capable of showing
multiple line at once with different colour. This feature makes it easier for
users to compare among different types of statistic (figure
\ref{fig:2_graphs}). Through this interface, SRQ 6.1 and 6.2 are followed.\par

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{2 line graph}
  \caption{More than one line graph can be shown at a time}
  \label{fig:2_graphs}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Achievements} presents the Achievements interface, which aims
to motivate and inform users about their progress in meeting set goals. Similar
to other interfaces, it includes a \texttt{"BACK"} button at the top left for
returning to the main menu and is labeled with the heading
\texttt{"Achievements"}, accompanied by a medal icon to symbolise success and
recognition.\par

The interface is divided into two main sections. On the left, a box at the top
displays the number of achievements completed within the week, indicated as
\texttt{"0/4"} in this example, suggesting no goals have been met yet. Below
this summary, four boxes represent the achievements tied to the four main
functionalities of the system (steps, work, sleep, and water). Each box
includes a white checkbox that is ticked off when the corresponding daily goal
is achieved.\par

\newpage

On the right half of the screen, a white text box provides a summary of the
total activities completed for each functionality during the week, assisting
users in tracking their weekly progress. Additionally, a streak counter is
placed above the activity summaries, encouraging users to consistently meet
their daily goals and build long-term habits.\par

Together, these interfaces support the app’s objective to engage users actively
in tracking their progress and achieving their health and productivity goals,
perfectly complying with SRQ 7.1 and allowing users to compare data with
others, complying with ARQ 1.\par


\section{Software Testing and Verification} \label{sec:testing}

During the initial planning of this project, the approach to testing was
discussed and a testing plan was created,  see Figure \ref{fig:TestDesign}
in Appendix \ref{app:testing}. It was agreed that, initially, each time a 
developer completed a feature from the product backlog, it would be thoroughly 
white-box tested by the developer using a variety of specifically chosen manual 
test cases and screenshots would be taken to record the results. If all tests 
produced the desired results, the developer would consider the feature complete. 
If any tests were unsuccessful, however, they would debug and fix the problem 
before applying all tests again. If the error was found in another developer's 
code during joint work, the error and the test results would be provided to the 
person responsible and the programmers involved would collaborate on the debugging. 
In this way, the component's functionality given both valid and invalid inputs would 
be ensured. 

By testing each element before combining it with other elements of the system, the 
manual testing process as a whole would comprise a bottom-up integration testing approach. 
On the completion of a section of the product backlog, the developer would send 
the screenshots produced in testing to the product owner. The product owner would 
then analyse the screenshots to ensure that the evidenced functionality aligned 
with the requirements of the product backlog; to provide feedback to the developers; 
and to inform future decisions and alterations to the product backlog. Additionally, 
the product owner would manually test the system functionality during sprint planning 
meetings to provide a form of black-box testing.\par

Once the system as a whole was developed, the second stage of testing would be 
implemented, in which unit tests would be designed and used by developers to 
more thoroughly scour the system for bugs and inconsistencies. These automated 
and time-efficient tests would effectively provide a second layer of protection 
against errors in the code. With the system completed, these tests would be able 
to target the complete testing of the interactions between the database, the API 
and the system itself.\par

Our approach to testing was very effective in ensuring a lack of bugs 
in our code. The programmers in our group were very good at ensuring that 
their code initially contained no bugs so the manual testing stage 
revealed very few errors and unit tests even fewer. However, the clearly 
defined two-stage approach to testing made the process much smoother and 
more robust and provided confidence in the stability of the final product.\par 

\subsection{Manual Testing}
The manual testing of our system can be considered in two main parts due to 
the program's design. Firstly, that of consistent data entry and the 
corresponding graph. And, secondly, the testing of the responsiveness and 
behaviour of goals and achievements. This is reflected in the test plan in 
Appendix \ref{app:testing}. The data entry portion of this testing required 
the intelligent selection of inputs to test general cases, edge cases and 
invalid input. An example of this was the following test case used to check 
the response of input boxes to incomplete inputs(See Figure \ref{fig:ManualTest2}). 
In this case an error was found, as the input caused the program to crash. 
The developer was quickly able to remedy this by adding an extra condition 
to the processing code.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Test} & \textbf{Expected Result}\\
        \hline
        Incomplete inputs are handled gracefully 
        & Input a decimal point 
        & Input is treated as a zero\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The second section of the manual testing phase involved the testing of the 
Achievement and Goal sections. Data input was less important to this part, 
serving purely to allow the reaching of different possibilities within the 
system. For example, in the test cases below, the developer used manual 
inputs to get to a state of having an achievement and then leave that state. 
In this example, the programmer discovered that if an achievement's 
requirement was reached and then the data was updated so that the requirement 
was no longer reached, some results were displayed incorrectly on the 
Achievements page (See Figure \ref{fig:ManualTest1}). The source of this issue 
was swiftly located and removed by the developer on discovery.\par
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Test} & \textbf{Expected Result}\\
        \hline
        Achievement page highlights completed achievements & Input data which 
        completes an achievement & Achievement page highlights completion and 
        shows correct progress \\
        \hline
        Achievement page does not highlight previously completed achievements 
        which are no longer complete & Input data which completes an achievement 
        then edit data so that achievement is not completed & Achievement page 
        reverts highlighting and progress label\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
A relatively major issue that was found in this area was goals not correctly 
expiring once their dedicated end time was reached 
(See Figure \ref{fig:ManualTest3}). Once the test case below had been checked, 
the bug was quickly found and solved.\par
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Test} & \textbf{Expected Result}\\
        \hline
        Goals expire once end time has been reached 
        & Allow a goal to end uncompleted 
        & Goal shows failure and ends\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Unit Testing}
Unit testing was also divided into two parts in line with our test plan: 
Direct data entry testing and API integration testing. In function, direct 
data entry unit testing was effectively a more robust and exhaustive version 
of the manual testing of the same functionality, covering standard inputs, 
edge cases and invalid inputs. For example, figure \ref{fig:Database Unit Test 2} 
shows a unit test designed to check that updating the number of steps a user has 
completed has the correct effect on the database. Similarly, a unit test 
ensuring correct database editing upon the creation of a new goal can be seen 
in figure \ref{fig:Database Unit Test 3}. A variety of further unit tests and 
their results can be found in Appendix \ref{app:testing}. Pleasingly, this unit 
testing did not uncover any issues with our code, showcasing the effectiveness of 
our manual testing and the initial programming of the system.\par

The unit testing of the API's interaction was similar to the first set of unit 
tests in terms of the tests themselves. For each action that the API could be 
involved in, a unit test was designed to ensure that the effect on the database 
caused by the action was identical to the effect which would be caused by the same 
action performed manually.\par



\section{Reflection and Conclusion}

With our PI system now complete and the majority of the specified requirements met, we can 
reflect on the merits and failures of our system and development approach. To do 
this we will critically analyse the way our system was designed and specified, 
as well as the approach we followed during development. By doing this we will 
be able to conclude how successful our project was, consider
future alterations to our system and analyse ways in which our approach could 
be improved. Learning from this, we will be able to develop systems more 
successfully and efficiently in the future. Unfortunately, due to the deadline for the 
completion of our  project, it is not possible to utilise our system for a
significant period of time in order to properly gauge how well it works from 
a user's perspective but we can still evaluate it from a critical viewpoint 
and make educated speculations about its effectiveness.\par

\subsection{System Development} 

The creation of the specification for our system began with research to establish
the interests of our target demographic. The biggest parts of this research
were an online form distributed to our peers and some interviews (see Appendix
\ref{app:survey} and \ref{app:interviews}). The results of these were very
helpful and were the driving force behind our choice of tracking metrics.
However, while this approach was sound and successful in gathering information,
only around twenty individuals filled in the form and we only managed to
interview two individuals. This is a large enough number of people that we feel
comfortable with using the results as a guide, especially given the clear
majority in the opinions of the form respondents. However, in future investigations, ensuring
a larger sample size would improve the reliability of our results and, at the
very least, make us more certain of our decisions.\par

Our choice of tracking metrics was informed both by data gathering and by 
research into other PI systems. This meant that our final list of four metrics 
reflected the desires of our peers, as well as our informed opinions on the 
most beneficial choices. On reflection, these four metrics still seem to 
provide an excellent and balanced summary of an individual's physical and 
mental health in a way that appears likely to provide useful insights and 
achievable targets. We are therefore confident that our choice of metrics is 
sound. However, due to the variety of research responses, especially from the 
interviewees, it was not possible to take the views of every individual into 
account; there were a few features suggested during the interviews which were 
not added to the specification, either due to the need to limit the scope of 
the system or because they didn't align with the conclusions of other 
respondents or with our research. In future, looking back on this research or 
through conducting more thorough research, we could implement extra features 
over a longer period if a large proportion of our user base shared a desire for a particular feature.\par

One key requirement we specified for our system, which is a very important 
feature of any PI system, was the ability to log data. This specification was 
clearly met, with the user able to log their progress in all four metrics. The 
manual data entry process is also very simple and intuitive. 
Furthermore, by implementing it in this way we have made the data entry 
aspect of our PI system as effortless as possible, thereby making the use of 
our system more pleasant for the user. The system also has the ability to use 
the Fitbit API to gather data, as specified in the requirements. While this 
does work well and fulfils the requirements, Fitbit refresh API tokens on a 
regular basis. This means that users are regularly required to re-enter their 
Fitbit API token for our system to gather their data, reducing the benefits of 
the automated tracking. In future, it would be beneficial to look into 
avoiding this problem so that the effort required on the part of the user is 
minimised. Avoiding this is presumably possible as the Fitbit mobile app is 
reportedly built using this API and does not require repeated token entry from 
users.\par

Another important PI feature outlined by our specification was the 
intuitive display of user data and progress. This requirement was successfully 
met through the use of a software library specialising in graphs. Using this library
we managed to create aesthetic, interactive and detailed graphs for chosen all metrics chosen 
by the user, giving users insight into health variations in their lifestyle. A possible 
area for improvement in this section would be the highlighting of particularly 
healthy periods of time to motivate the user, as this has been shown to promote 
positive reflection (Loerakker et al., 2023). However, the functionality of 
this feature certainly meets the requirements we set out.\par

Another key feature of our requirements is the inclusion of 
goals and achievements. This was also successfully implemented and provides 
an effective way to track progress towards goals and to provide motivation, 
making it a worthwhile part of the specification and the system. In the future, a possible
improvement would be the ability to view other users' 
achievements within the application. Whilst successes can be displayed in-person or via 
the sharing of screenshots, a built-in system 
would make this easier and could help spread word of the system to more 
students who might find it useful. Additionally, the ability to have multiple 
goals per activity could be beneficial for some users. For example those who 
would like to have a short-term goal and a longer term goal.\par

The database our system uses is designed to intuitively integrate with the 
structure of our software. Additionally, it is quick and easy to understand and access. The 
addition of future metrics to our system would not be challenging to implement, 
simply requiring an associated table. However, whilst our database is intuitive, 
it could be normalised further by adding a bridging table with 
activity IDs. The benefit of this change would be increased efficiency and 
ease of further development. Adding new metrics would likely only require an 
extra record in the Activities table. However, there would also be downsides 
to this approach; understanding the layout of the database would be less 
simple, relying on keeping track of foreign keys and more complicated database 
queries. \par

Our class design closely resembles that of our database and is therefore
similarly intuitive. If we were to alter the database design, careful
alterations to the interface between the database and the code could maintain
the clarity of data storage from a programming perspective by minimising
changes in the class design.\par

As per our specification, the PI system is a locally-run PC application. This 
is beneficial to users when it comes to the viewing of the graphical statistics 
provided by the program as the majority of computers running the program will 
likely have a larger screen than a tablet or smartphone. However, it also 
requires that users log data using a large device. This could become quite 
burdensome, especially when away from home due to the these requirements. 
Given the widespread use of smartphones which are 
carried almost everywhere, a future improvement to our system would be 
to allow the tracking of data on mobile devices, making the process much more 
portable and accessible.\par

Our approach to the test-driven development of our system worked effectively in 
practice, with developers finding most of the bugs in their own code during 
testing and the finished product working effectively with no known issues. By 
using white-box testing the developers were able to apply tests based on their 
in-depth knowledge of the processes involved, thereby anticipating problems 
others would not. However, on one occasion, a bug went unnoticed by the initial 
testing and was only picked up by the product owner. This implies that, in 
future, a combination of white-box and black-box testing might prove to be more 
robust due to the diverse perspectives provided by group work.\par  

\subsection{Software Process}
To develop this product we followed the Scrum framework and the Agile 
methodology of software development with the aim of allowing us to structure 
and manage the creation of the system in an effective and methodical way. We 
managed to complete five week-long sprints during the development process with 
the sprint backlog successfully cleared during the majority of the sprints and 
mostly cleared during the rest.  This process ensured that we kept working at a sensible 
pace whilst adhering to the specification. It also 
allowed the system requirements to evolve during development, leading to a 
significantly improved final product.\par

However, our development process was by no means perfect. One way in which we 
could have improved our adherence to the Scrum framework 
would have been the inclusion of more frequent Scrum meetings. During our 
sprints, frequent Scrum meetings were held to discuss progress but they did 
not always occur on a daily basis. Holding daily scrum meetings would have 
been impossible given our busy and clashing schedules, especially during 
the Easter Break when developers had significant plans outside of work. 
However, more Scrum meetings could have been held on occasion and may have 
improved communication and understanding within the group.\par

Another notable way the Agile methodology allowed us to evolve our requirements 
was in the design of the system's database. In a sprint planning session 
during the development process, we established that our database 
could be improved by adjusting the design. The product 
backlog was updated to include this new design and the change was implemented 
as part of the sprint that followed, making the database more efficient. In 
this way, the Agile methodology helped us avoid future problems and work by 
allowing flexibility during the development process.\par

\newpage

One part of the process that worked effectively for our group was 
the sprint planning weekly meetings. By having a member of the team run the 
meetings, and through open communication, we managed to always ensure that 
every member of the team had something to do and could work on them 
effectively during the sprint so that the group as a whole produced 
meaningful results during the sprint and finished the project before 
the deadline.\par

\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, through carefully considered design and adherence to Agile
methods, we managed to successfully produce a working PI system in an organised
way. We believe that this system is intuitive, informative and robust.
Furthermore, our approach to testing and development was effective, however
testing could have been improved by incorporating a more collaborative system.
Therefore, the development of this system has primarily been a success.
Despite this, there are areas in which the system could be improved in the future
to increase ease of use which, given a longer development time, could have been
addressed accordingly.\par

\section{Appendix: Interview Transcripts}\label{app:interviews}

\textbf{Interviewee: Edwin Smith}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Q\arabic*:}, leftmargin=*, align=left]
    \item What are you looking for in an app to help you improve your sleep schedule?
    \begin{quote}
        Something that relaxes me.
    \end{quote}

    \item How many hours of sleep do you get on average, per day?
    \begin{quote}
        Around 10 hours of sleep, however, I want to reduce this amount.
    \end{quote}

    \item Do you think that your calorie intake is greater than, less than, or around the same as the daily calorie intake of the average adult?
    \begin{quote}
        Probably more, but I am happy as I am. My metabolism is high and the daily average also depends on your physical build.
    \end{quote}

    \item Would you be open to participating in challenges/competitions within the app to help you meet your fitness goals? If so, what kind of challenges are you looking for?
    \begin{quote}
        Yes, I would be down for challenges, especially amongst other people or friends. Since I am an avid gym enthusiast, it would be cool to see a “who can eat ‘n’ amount of calories in a day” kind of challenge. Note that this is only for bulking reasons, however you can implement better calorie intakes depending on what the person wants. Having a challenge based on the number of steps or distance traveled would improve my cardio a lot, especially if a friend of mine could also join in.
    \end{quote}

    \item How important is the user interface for you? Will you like a simple minimalistic design, or a UI consisting of more options and possibly more complex?
    \begin{quote}
        I would like a simple but powerful UI, which allows you to see a bunch of data visualised. I would like to see a leaderboard of my friends, and a weekly challenges button so it keeps everyone busy.
    \end{quote}

    \item Any other information you believe could be useful?
    \begin{quote}
        No.
    \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\textbf{Interviewee: Oliver Niles}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Q\arabic*:}, resume, leftmargin=*, align=left]
    \item Are there any visualisations or reports you would like to see to help you understand your fitness data better?
    \begin{quote}
        Yes, I would like to see line graphs where I can customise the range of data, ranging from days to years. Every week I would like a report which outlines the key data points of my fitness in order to determine what I can do to improve.
    \end{quote}

    \item What kind of feedback/encouragement would you like to see from the app, and how would you like this to be displayed?
    \begin{quote}
        You could implement a point system as a form of encouragement, where you could customise your account and compare with other friends on the app. I am more likely to use the app if it is more competitive with other people.
    \end{quote}

    \item How important are social features, like being able to view other people’s achievements, like your friends?
    \begin{quote}
        Quite important to be able to view other people’s achievements, but you could make it so your account is not visible to other people as well. However, it is important to focus on yourself because sometimes it can be unrealistic especially if the person you are comparing with is not at a level that you are at.
    \end{quote}

    \item Do you have any fitness/health goals that you would like the app to help you achieve?
    \begin{quote}
        Yes, I would like to be able to gain muscle over the next year by tracking my calorie intake and exercises that I have done. I’d also like to be able to get more sleep using the app’s recommended bedtime schedule for my goals.
    \end{quote}

    \item Any other information you believe could be useful?
    \begin{quote}
        After I input the calories of a meal, I would like to have the option to save the meal as a preset which I can add to any day, which automatically adds the calories of that meal to my daily calories count so that I don’t have to type it in each time.
