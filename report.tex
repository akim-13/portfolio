\section{Introduction (2 pages)}

\textbf{An account of the problem your software system is intended to address, including a
description of the problem area (Personal Informatics) supported by relevant literature (See
NFR3.1 and NFR3.2), what can make a PI software system effective for its users, and a clear
statement of the main idea behind your particular PI software system.}

Increasingly, medical advice and research is showing that minor changes to an individual’s daily routines can have positive effects on their overall health, wellbeing and productivity. For example we are often reminded of the advantages of walking 10,000 steps (Tudor-Locke et al., 2011), sleeping for at least 7 hours (Watson et al., 2015) and drinking at least 6 cups of water (NHS, 2023) every day. However, as discussed by Madore and Wagner (2019), processing multiple tasks concurrently can lead to reduced efficiency. Therefore, tools to aid in the tracking and pursuing of these personal development goals are likely to help an individual reach their goals more effectively.\par

PI(Personal Informatics) software is software designed to help collect and analyse data about an individual with the aim of promoting self-understanding and betterment. A PI system could be an ideal solution to this issue as they could be very useful in allowing an individual to monitor and streamline their progress towards their goals for self-improvement.\par

However, in designing a PI system it is important to ensure user engagement; if a user stops using a system then the system can’t help them. Kersten-van Dijk et al. (2017) found that the studies they reviewed which discussed users dropping out of using a PI system reported dropout rates of 7-44\%. This suggests that a significant proportion of people might not feel motivated to continue using PI software. Furthermore, Jones and Kelly (2018) found that presenting users with too much information could leave them feeling overwhelmed; Rapp and Cena (2016) found that first-time users of PI systems could find the act of recording their data burdensome; and Potapov et al. (2021) discovered that teenagers often found PI systems either controlling or confusing depending on the way they were designed.\par

Fortunately, some of these studies, as well as many others, have investigated how to make a PI software system effective for its users and proposed ways of designing systems with this in mind. For instance, Jones and Kelly (2018) suggested that, to avoid overwhelming users, a system should only show the user information that is interesting to them. They found that interesting information was that which was surprising, useful or statistically significant. It was also found that users found it more interesting when insights could be provided between aspects of their life, rather than within them. Rapp and Cena (2016) recommended providing users with tailored summaries and targets; control over their data; and reviews of past data. In this way they suggested that feelings of freedom and nostalgia might be fostered, increasing positive views and connections with the software. Potapov et al. emphasise the importance of finding an appropriate balance between constraints to orient the user towards positive goals and freedom to allow them to use the tool in a way that suits them. Additionally, a study by Loerakker et al. (2023) showed that promoting self-compassion through the design of a Personal Informatics system can foster positive self-reflection while reducing the chances of rumination and cessation of goal pursuit. The study showed that framing data positively can promote self-compassion. For example, highlighting positive achievements rather than criticising poorer performance.\par

Our intention is to create a PI system aimed at current university students.  The metrics we intend to track are hours of sleep, steps taken, hours spent productively and water intake. We arrived at this list of metrics by means of a survey and interviews which gauged interest in different metrics within our target audience. Our survey revealed that 60\% of respondents were most interested in tracking their health , followed by 30\% who were most interested in tracking their own learning and development. Our system will allow manual data entry. Some metrics will also use automatic data collection via API to make using the software easier. Additionally, it will allow users to set personal goals and see useful data about their performance. This data will be able to showcase any correlation in each metric against time individually and between separate metrics. This functionality will all take place within a desktop application with a graphical user interface. We hope that, by tracking these four important aspects of student life, our system will provide interesting and useful insights that guide our users towards better health and productivity while ensuring that they aren't overwhelmed by too much data or the need to balance their goals.


\section{Agile Software Process Planning and Management (2 pages)}

This section must describe how you carried out your project as an Agile process, including
how you planned and tracked your sprints, and how Scrum meetings were used to manage
the evolution of your idea and the features you decided to include in your software system.


\section{Specification of Software Requirements (5 pages)}

This section breaks down what we need for our Personal Informatics (PI) system, 
focusing on helping students keep up with their fitness and study goals. 
We've used feedback from surveys, talks with users, and research articles to 
figure out what features our system should have. Our aim is to make a system 
that really helps students improve their daily habits and studies.\par

III.1. Establishing Detailed System Requirements
We started by asking people what they're looking for in an app like ours. We found out that most students are really into tracking their fitness (60%) and want to keep an eye on their learning progress too (30%). This helped us get a good idea of what our app should focus on.
Next, we looked at what users said about our initial ideas and checked out what experts say in articles. People told us they like apps that are easy to use but still do a lot. They also want to connect with friends through the app and like the idea of seeing all their info in one place.\par
After all this, we made a final list of what our app needs to do. We're making sure it's good at tracking health and study time, lets users share their progress with friends, and keeps all their data safe and private.\par
 
III.2. Specific Domain Description (will add more thing to this after the meeting, this is an example)
The PI system is intricately designed with a student demographic at its core, addressing their unique challenges such as managing academic deadlines alongside maintaining a balanced lifestyle.\par
Students grapple with the dual challenges of academic accountability and physical well-being. The system is poised to provide an integrative suite of tools for effective study habits, fitness tracking, and fostering a socially supportive ecosystem.\par
 
III.3. Uses
Our app is mainly for people who need a hand managing their time healthily. We know many people have difficulty balancing their work and their private life. Our app aims to help them track their life style along with their diet\par
-    Tracking sleep time: The system will calculate the time users spend a day for sleeping and do statistic with it to find a pattern.\\
-    Tracking calorie intake: The system receive the calorie intake everyday by users and find a pattern along with comparing with the calorie that users spend that day and give suggestion about their diet.\\
-    Calculating calorie output: From the exercises that users take, the system will find out how much energy do users burn in a day and use them along with calorie intake to make suggestion about life style and diet.\\
-    Challenges: Users can do challenges themselves or with their friends. They can choose the difficulty of the challenges and it can be changed everyday if users may want to do other kinds or difficulties of challenge.\\
…
(Add more later)
III.4. Requirement
III.4.1. Functional Requirements
-    Data Tracking: Users should be able to easily enter and track their sleep hours, physical activities, and more. And we uses different means to track every users behavior.\\
-    Social Features: The app should offer social interaction, such as challenges and sharing achievements with friends.\\
-    Notifications: Customizable reminders to help users stay on track with their goals.\\
-    Account system: Users can register and have their own accounts to manage their data easier\\
-    Allow users to enter data that is not tracked: This can help with stats like calorie intake or why kind of food they ate so that the app know additional data, which makes it easier to find users’ behaviour pattern.\\
-    Compare users’ data overtime: This function help users manage the difference in a specific type of data over days or hours, this help them to know if the changes they make are positive or negative.\\
-    Allow users to compare different data together in a fixed time: Some of the data might link to another somehow, eg mood might affect sleep quality, lack or spare of exercises might affect mood and sleep quality as well, so this make both users and the system so see clearly how changes affect users life style and to come up with solutions to improve behaviour pattern.\\
-    Challenges: Allow users to set, change their goals, it can be social, such as friendly challenges between classmates. The system should have suggestions to users in setting their goals and the time frame to make it suitable to the users, or else they might lose interest over time if they set all the goals too difficult and could not finish any of it.\\
 
III.4.2. Non-Functional Requirements
-    Usability: The app must be intuitive and simple to navigate for all users.\\
-    Scalability: It should be capable of handling an increase in users and additional features over time.\\
-    Security: User data must be kept secure, with privacy settings that users can control.\\
-    Performance: The app needs to be responsive and reliable, providing a smooth user experience.\\
-    Follow SCRUM framework: We have sprints and meeting every week to make sure everything go smoothly, and we have a Scrum Master to make sure that the progress is in the right way.\\
-    Expanding initial requirements: pending\\
-    Background research: We did articles research, however, most of them are in the PI field, which narrows down our view on how to build the system. It is helpful if we do more research outside of this field which might give us more idea about functional requirements and how to implement them.\\
-    	Testing: pending\\



\section{Design (5 pages)}

This section should include:

A set of UML models describing the low-level design of your system (class models,
sequence diagrams, etc.)

A justification of your chosen design. This should explicitly show how your design
meets both functional and non-functional requirements, making direct reference
them and the rationale behind your design as it embodies your PI idea.

Make sure you include explanatory text with your design models: the meaning of a diagram
Page 9 of 11
is very rarely self-evident because it depends on an explanatory frame for interpretation. So
you must make sure to express in words what you wish the reader to understand by them.


\section{Software Testing (Verification) (2 pages)}

This section should include:

Testing plans, indicating how you planned to perform verification of your PI system.
These plans should reflect your requirements and design work, and be completed
before any implementation (coding) work begins.

Evidence of testing - test case results.


\section{Reflection and Conclusion (4 pages)}

This section should include two main sections:

A critique of your software system’s requirements specification, design and testing,
including what might be improved and why you feel it would be better with these
changes.

A critical reflection on the group’s software process, including evidence of Agility in
your software process, evidence of having evolved your requirements to reflect
changes in understanding of problem and viability of designs.
