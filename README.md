# Plagiarism Warning
Students of Bath, please note that all code in this repository is used in
university's ${\color{red}\text{automatic}}$ ${\color{red}\text{plagiarism}}$ ${\color{red}\text{detection}}$ ${\color{red}\text{system}}$, which means that using
code snippets of any length in your coursework *will* trigger it. It is a
sophisticated system that can detect even altered code, from rearranged functions
to changed variable names.

Moreover, this repository is known to and is ${\color{red}\text{monitored}}$
${\color{red}\text{by}}$ ${\color{red}\text{university}}$
${\color{red}\text{staff}}$, so even reusing the ideas or non-code materials
might get you in trouble. 

Plagiarism is a serious offense that might lead to severe consequences. For more
information refer to Bath's [Penalties for Academic
Misconduct](https://www.bath.ac.uk/campaigns/academic-integrity-penalties-for-academic-misconduct/)
page.
