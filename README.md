# Plagiarism Warning

Students of Bath, please be aware that all code in this repository is subject
to the university's ${\color{red}\text{automatic}}$
${\color{red}\text{plagiarism}}$ ${\color{red}\text{detection}}$
${\color{red}\text{system}}$. This means that using any code snippets from here
in your coursework *will* trigger it. The plagiarism detection system
is sophisticated and can identify even modified code, including rearranged
functions, changed variable names, and more.

Moreover, this repository is known to and is ${\color{red}\text{monitored}}$
${\color{red}\text{by}}$ ${\color{red}\text{university}}$
${\color{red}\text{staff}}$, so even reusing the ideas or non-code materials
might get you in trouble.

Plagiarism is a serious offense that can lead to severe consequences. For more
information, refer to Bath's [Penalties for Academic
Misconduct](https://www.bath.ac.uk/campaigns/academic-integrity-penalties-for-academic-misconduct/)
page.
