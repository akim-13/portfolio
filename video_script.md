## Introduction

Today we're going to present how our dear friend Akim implemented a neural
network that detects spam emails. Steve, over to you.


## Difficulty of Approach

Thanks,Donny.Implementing a neural network for spam classification presents
challenges due to the complex mathematics involved.However,this approach excels
over simpler algorithms like Naive Bayes or decision trees due to its inherent
versatility,enabled by a wide range of optimization techniques.

This adaptability makes neural networks particularly effective at handling the
complex patterns in email data, thereby providing a robust solution for spam
detection.


## Implementation

The network consists of 4 layers, including 2 hidden layers. The 1st dense layer,
"A", receives a batch data from 54 input neurons, modified by randomly initialized
weights and zeroed biases. The ReLU activation function determines if neurons in layer A
fire, passing data to the 2nd dense layer, B.

This layer uses the sigmoid function to output the spam probability into a single
neuron. Loss is calculated using mean squared error and is backpropagated to
update parameters using Stochastic Gradient Descent. This process is then
repeated for hundreds of epochs.


## Optimization

There are several key optimizations in the model: Data mini-batching leverages
parallel computing for faster training and helps prevent overfitting by providing
a noisy gradient. The ReLU activation function in dense layers mitigates the
vanishing gradient problem. 

Thus, it effectively enhances the learning of deep layers. The sigmoid output
layer translates logits to probabilities, crucial for binary classification
accuracy; and the SGD optimizer is used to avoid local minima, thereby ensuring
quick and stable convergence.


## Explanation and Contextualization of Results

Averaging 92% accuracy, the neural network effectively classifies spam, though it
falls short of the near 98% accuracy achieved by top-tier ensemble models. This
performance indicates readiness for practical use, with room for improvement
across varying types of spam. 

To enhance precision, adopting Binary Cross Entropy as a loss function and
implementing validation techniques could prevent potential overfitting and
improve model robustness. However, the most significant enhancement would be the
expansion of the training dataset.
