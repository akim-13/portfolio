Multi-Room Disco System
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
One arduino used to process and control outputs to the other agent arduinos.

Inputs:
Buttons - Used to pause and play music.
Infrafred/Motion Sensor - Turns off music when motion isn't detected for an extended period (saves energy).
Potentiometer - Turn music up and down on each of the agent arudinos.
Volume Sensor - Safety feature which turns down the volume if a new speaker is too loud. Failsafe to notify the parent arduino if a speaker is broken.

Outputs:
LEDs - Disco lights to BPM of any song.
Speakers - Play music.
LCD - Shows volume in each room. Warns when music is too loud. Announces songs in each room.

Justification:
Motion & volume detector arduino - When everyone leaves, turn off the music (saves energy).

Questions:
- How much justification to seperate Arduinos?
- Can we hook up and SD card to an Arduino to play music?
- Do they have all the sensorys necessary?
